# Matrix operation demos

This repository contains different implementations of the same small app - a matrix operation calculator.
Each implementation uses a different stack. The purpose of this is to get a first taste for different tools and frameworks - something more than a "hello world" app, but not so big that it takes weeks to complete.

Stack aside, the implementations are meant to be practical clones.

## Implementations 

All implementations use Typescript.

- [x] React
  (The React project is built using Vite, and Lerna sometimes terminates Vite's dev server immediately after starting it. 
  To test out the React demo in dev, cd into `packages/frontend-react` then run `yarn dev`)
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Vue
- [ ] Svelte
